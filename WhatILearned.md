# Introduction Takeaways

## Review:
I've used GitHub and Git for software projects (SDE) and for hardware/PCB projects for Solar Car. As a result, I was already familiar with the structure of GitHub as well as branching, committing, pulling, and pushing.

## New Information:
While I've used GitHub for projects, I've never been familiar with the more collaborative aspects such as Forks, Issues, and the Projects features.
I now understand that forks are generally like branching, but for the purpose of modifying and contributing to a repository that isn't yours and that you may not have permissions for.
I ran into this with my own repository when my invite wasn't working.

It was also interesting to learn about Issues, task tracking, and project boards. I wasn't aware of all the project management tools GitHub offered and will probably have to use them and become more familiar with them as my need for documenting my work increases.
