## Forks:

I've used GitHub in clubs and other classes, so I'm familiar with most of the concepts covered. However, I had never heard of forks until this tutorial. I thought branching was the only option for breaking off from a repository and isolating changes. I would like to know more about what features distinguish a fork from a branch.
